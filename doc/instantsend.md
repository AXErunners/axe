## InstantSend Technical Information

InstantSend has been integrated into the Core Daemon in two ways:
* "push" notifications (ZMQ and `-instantsendnotify` cmd-line/config option);
* RPC commands.

#### ZMQ

When a "Transaction Lock" occurs the hash of the related transaction is broadcasted through ZMQ using both the `zmqpubrawtxlock` and `zmqpubhashtxlock` channels.

* `zmqpubrawtxlock`: publishes the raw transaction when locked via InstantSend
* `zmqpubhashtxlock`: publishes the transaction hash when locked via InstantSend

This mechanism has been integrated into Bitcore-Node-Axe which allows for notification to be broadcast through Insight API in one of two ways:
* WebSocket: [https://github.com/axerunners/insight-api-axe#web-socket-api](https://github.com/axerunners/insight-api-axe#web-socket-api)
* API: [https://github.com/axerunners/insight-api-axe#instantsend-transactions](https://github.com/axerunners/insight-api-axe#instantsend-transactions)

#### Command line option

When a wallet InstantSend transaction is successfully locked a shell command provided in this option is executed (`%s` in `<cmd>` is replaced by TxID):

```
-instantsendnotify=<cmd>
```

#### RPC

Details pertaining to an observed "Transaction Lock" can also be retrieved through RPC, itâ€™s important however to understand the underlying mechanism.

By default, the Axe Core daemon will launch using the following constant:

```
static const int DEFAULT_INSTANTSEND_DEPTH = 5;
```

This value can be overridden by passing the following argument to the Axe Core daemon:

```
-instantsenddepth=<n>
```

The key thing to understand is that this value indicates the number of "confirmations" a successful Transaction Lock represents. When Wallet RPC commands which support `minconf` and `addlockconf` parameters (such as `listreceivedbyaddress`) are performed and `addlockconf` is `true`, then `instantsenddepth` attribute is taken into account when returning information about the transaction. In this case the value in `confirmations` field you see through RPC is showing the number of `"Blockchain Confirmations" + "InstantSend Depth"` (assuming the funds were sent via InstantSend).

There is also a field named `instantlock` (that is present in commands such as `listsinceblock`). The value in this field indicates whether a given transaction is locked via InstantSend.

**Examples**

1. `listreceivedbyaddress 0 true`
   * InstantSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 5
   * InstantSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 6
   * non-InstantSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
   * non-InstantSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1

2. `listreceivedbyaddress 0`
   * InstantSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
   * InstantSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1
   * non-InstantSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
   * non-InstantSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1

3. `listsinceblock`
    * InstantSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
        * instantlock: true
    * InstantSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1
        * instantlock: true
    * non-InstantSend transaction just occurred:
        * confirmations: 0
        * instantlock: false
    * non-InstantSend transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
        * confirmations: 1
        * instantlock: false
