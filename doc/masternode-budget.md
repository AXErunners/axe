Masternode Budget API
=======================

Axe now supports full decentralized budgets that are paid directly from the blockchain via superblocks once per month.

Budgets go through a series of stages before being paid:
 * prepare - create a special transaction that destroys coins in order to make a proposal
 * submit - propagate transaction to peers on network
 * voting - lobby for votes on your proposal
 * get enough votes - make it into the budget
 * finalization - at the end of each payment period, proposals are sorted then compiled into a finalized budget
 * finalized budget voting - masternodes that agree with the finalization will vote on that budget
 * payment - the winning finalized budget is paid


1. Prepare collateral transaction
--

In this transaction we prepare collateral for "_cool-project_". This proposal will pay _1200_ AXE, _12_ times over the course of a year totaling _24000_ AXE.

**Warning: if you change any fields within this command, the collateral transaction will become invalid.**

Format: ```mngovernance prepare proposal-name url payment-count block-start axe-address monthly-payment-axe```

Example: ```mngovernance prepare cool-project http://www.cool-project/one.json 12 100000 y6R9oN12KnB9zydzTLc3LikD9cCjjQzYG7 1200 true```

Output: ```464a0eb70ea91c94295214df48c47baa72b3876cfb658744aaf863c7b5bf1ff0```

This is the collateral hash, copy this output for the next step.

2 Submit proposal to network
--

Now we can submit our proposal to the network.

Format: ```mngovernance submit proposal-name url payment-count block-start axe-address monthly-payment-axe fee-tx```

Example: ```mngovernance submit cool-project http://www.cool-project/one.json 12 100000 y6R9oN12KnB9zydzTLc3LikD9cCjjQzYG7 1200 464a0eb70ea91c94295214df48c47baa72b3876cfb658744aaf863c7b5bf1ff0```

Output : ```a2b29778ae82e45a973a94309ffa6aa2e2388b8f95b39ab3739f0078835f0491```

This is your proposal hash, which other nodes will use to vote on it.

3. Lobby for votes
--

Double check your information.

Format: ```mngovernance getproposal proposal-hash```

Example: ```mngovernance getproposal a2b29778ae82e45a973a94309ffa6aa2e2388b8f95b39ab3739f0078835f0491```
￼
```
{
    "Name" : "cool-project",
    "Hash" : "a2b29778ae82e45a973a94309ffa6aa2e2388b8f95b39ab3739f0078835f0491",
    "FeeHash" : "464a0eb70ea91c94295214df48c47baa72b3876cfb658744aaf863c7b5bf1ff0",
    "URL" : "http://www.cool-project/one.json",
    "BlockStart" : 100000,
    "BlockEnd" : 100625,
    "TotalPaymentCount" : 12,
    "RemainingPaymentCount" : 12,
    "PaymentAddress" : "y6R9oN12KnB9zydzTLc3LikD9cCjjQzYG7",
    "Ratio" : 0.00000000,
    "Yeas" : 0,
    "Nays" : 0,
    "Abstains" : 0,
    "TotalPayment" : 14400.00000000,
    "MonthlyPayment" : 1200.00000000,
    "IsValid" : true,
    "fValid" : true
}
```

If everything looks correct, you can ask for votes from other masternodes. To vote on a proposal, load a wallet with _masternode.conf_ file. You do not need to access your cold wallet to vote for proposals.

Format: ```mngovernance vote proposal-hash [yes|no]```

Example: ```mngovernance vote a2b29778ae82e45a973a94309ffa6aa2e2388b8f95b39ab3739f0078835f0491 yes```

4.  Make it into the budget
--

After you get enough votes, execute ```mngovernance projection``` to see if you made it into the budget. If you the budget was finalized at this moment which proposals would be in it. Note: Proposals must be active at least 1 day on the network and receive 10% of the masternode network in yes votes in order to qualify (E.g. if there is 3500 masternodes, you will need 350 yes votes.)

```mngovernance projection```:￼
```
{
    "cool-project" : {
        "Hash" : "a2b29778ae82e45a973a94309ffa6aa2e2388b8f95b39ab3739f0078835f0491",
        "FeeHash" : "464a0eb70ea91c94295214df48c47baa72b3876cfb658744aaf863c7b5bf1ff0",
        "URL" : "http://www.cool-project/one.json",
        "BlockStart" : 100000,
        "BlockEnd" : 100625,
        "TotalPaymentCount" : 12,
        "RemainingPaymentCount" : 12,
        "PaymentAddress" : "y6R9oN12KnB9zydzTLc3LikD9cCjjQzYG7",
        "Ratio" : 1.00000000,
        "Yeas" : 33,
        "Nays" : 0,
        "Abstains" : 0,
        "TotalPayment" : 14400.00000000,
        "MonthlyPayment" : 1200.00000000,
        "IsValid" : true,
        "fValid" : true
    }
}
```

5. Finalized budget
--

```
"main" : {
        "FeeTX" : "d6b8de9a4cadfe148f91e8fe8eed407199f96639b482f956ae6f539b8339f87c",
        "Hash" : "6e8bbaba5113de592f6888f200f146448440b7e606fcf62ef84e60e1d5ac7d64",
        "BlockStart" : 100000,

        "Proposals" : "cool-project",
        "VoteCount" : 46,
        "Status" : "OK"
    },
```

6. Get paid
