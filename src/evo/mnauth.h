/**
 * This class handles the p2p message MNAUTH. MNAUTH is sent directly after VERACK and authenticates the sender as a
 * masternode. It is only sent when the sender is actually a masternode.
 *
 * MNAUTH signs a challenge that was previously sent via VERSION. The challenge is signed differently depending on
 * the connection being an inbound or outbound connection, which avoids MITM of this form:
 *   node1 <- Eve -> node2
 * while still allowing:
 *   node1 -> Eve -> node2
 *
 * This is fine as we only use this mechanism for DoS protection. It allows us to keep masternode connections open for
 * a very long time without evicting the connections when inbound connection limits are hit (non-MNs will then be evicted).
 *
 * If we ever want to add transfer of sensitive data, THIS AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM IS NOT ENOUGH!! We'd need to implement
 * proper encryption for these connections first.
