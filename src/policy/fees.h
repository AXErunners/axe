/** \class CBlockPolicyEstimator
 * The BlockPolicyEstimator is used for estimating the feerate needed
 * for a transaction to be included in a block within a certain number of
 * blocks.
 *
 * At a high level the algorithm works by grouping transactions into buckets
 * based on having similar feerates and then tracking how long it
 * takes transactions in the various buckets to be mined.  It operates under
 * the assumption that in general transactions of higher feerate will be
 * included in blocks before transactions of lower feerate.   So for
 * example if you wanted to know what feerate you should put on a transaction to
 * be included in a block within the next 5 blocks, you would start by looking
 * at the bucket with the highest feerate transactions and verifying that a
 * sufficiently high percentage of them were confirmed within 5 blocks and
 * then you would look at the next highest feerate bucket, and so on, stopping at
 * the last bucket to pass the test.   The average feerate of transactions in this
 * bucket will give you an indication of the lowest feerate you can put on a
 * transaction and still have a sufficiently high chance of being confirmed
 * within your desired 5 blocks.
 *
 * Here is a brief description of the implementation:
 * When a transaction enters the mempool, we
 * track the height of the block chain at entry.  Whenever a block comes in,
 * we count the number of transactions in each bucket and the total amount of feerate
 * paid in each bucket. Then we calculate how many blocks Y it took each
 * transaction to be mined and we track an array of counters in each bucket
 * for how long it to took transactions to get confirmed from 1 to a max of 25
 * and we increment all the counters from Y up to 25. This is because for any
 * number Z>=Y the transaction was successfully mined within Z blocks.  We
 * want to save a history of this information, so at any time we have a
 * counter of the total number of transactions that happened in a given feerate
 * bucket and the total number that were confirmed in each number 1-25 blocks
 * or less for any bucket.   We save this history by keeping an exponentially
 * decaying moving average of each one of these stats.  Furthermore we also
 * keep track of the number unmined (in mempool) transactions in each bucket
 * and for how many blocks they have been outstanding and use that to increase
 * the number of transactions we've seen in that feerate bucket when calculating
 * an estimate for any number of confirmations below the number of blocks
 * they've been outstanding.
